// create function/onSubmit to get userInput from categories and # of questions
// use the value from userInput to call API
// use axios, fetch data from API.
// store questions in to useState
// Map through the questions array and display trivia
// Use the type object from API to display either multiple choice or true or false
// Display answer choices as radio?
// create a button for user answer submit. Once answer submitted, disabled the form so they cant go back and fix their answer
// Create a display, letting user know they are correct or wrong, and move on  to the next question (with set timeout probably).


// Create a button that initially displays Saved Games
// on click, use ternaries to toggle saved games and change the button display to Current Game
// Inside saved game, create an onclick function on the chevron so that the user can load their saved games from database
